# AVIONASE :: AIRPLANES

This is a similar game with ships. There are two game boards of 10 x 10 squares.
One game board is for the player and one for the computer.

The player starts the game by choosing an empty square on his board which will be the head of the first airplane. As soon as the head is chosen, all available directions are shown in green. The player must continue by clicking on the chosen green tiles to complete the full plane. After the first plane is finished, the player must choose another empty tile to be the head of the second plane and complete all the chosen green tiles to finish the plane.

_After both planes are on the game board the computer will generate it's own planes (hidden) , on it's game board._

The player must continue by choosing empty tiles on the computer's board to try and hit the planes. The computer will do the same. If an airplane head is hit, the whole plane will be destroyed. The first player (or computer) that destroys both enemy planes is the winner.

As you advance through levels (four available) the computer will have more planes but you will have only two planes in all levels.

There are some treasures available through the game and these will appear at random locations giving you more points to score.

##### LVL1 : 2 COMPUTER PLANES : 1 TREASURE
##### LVL2 : 3 COMPUTER PLANES : 2 TREASURES
##### LVL3 : 4 COMPUTER PLANES : 3 TREASURES
##### LVL4 : 5 COMPUTER PLANES : 4 TREASURES
